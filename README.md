<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

This is an academic project for the AI for Cybersecurity course (T596) at Indiana University as part of the MSITM program in the Kelley School of Business.

Our website consists of a responsive HTML5 + CSS template deployed to an Amazon Web Services S3 bucket. The AWS infrastructure is provisioned using Terragrunt & Terraform, and the website content is published using GitHub Actions. 

Check out the website here: http://bit.ly/AI4Cyber

<!-- GETTING STARTED -->
## Getting Started

Project members of Team 3 can clone this project, open a new branch in the editor of their choice and submit merge requests. Feel free to use GitHub's web IDE for making edits or other contributions as well. The bulk of the website content can be found in public/index.html

We are not strictly adhering to any branching strategy, but are very loosely following GitHub Flow :)

### Prerequisites

No prerequisites required for editing the website content. 

For Terragrunt & Terraform, you will need to follow the AWS documentation to configure the CLI and then install terraform and terragrunt. 

## Contributing

Contributions are only accepted by members of Team 3 taking IU's T596 AI for Cybersecurity course. Members of the general public can feel free to fork this project and use as they wish.

We are loosely following GitHub Flow, and pull requests are preferred - but we will also commit directly to master as deadlines require :)
